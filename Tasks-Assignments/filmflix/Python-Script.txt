This document is to explain my reasoning for producing a Python Script file to 
update text columns in my DB.

Ideally I wanted to insert real data into my DB with genuine ratings but struggled 
to contrain my column widths for my terminal reports.

I had hoped to format my 
columns using Pandas but was unable to ascertain how to import its functionality.

I had also investigated string slicing in the print() function but, again,
I couldn't get that to work.

Despite these setbacks I realised that whatever method I could implement would only 
give me a pre-selected string construction and, apart from the rating system at the 
start of the string, the output may well have appeared meaningless.

Therefore I descided to create a script in order to upate the data in my table in 
one go - affording me to format the records as I wished.
