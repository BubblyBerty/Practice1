        <!--&#43 is the plus operator
            &#61 is the equals sign
            &#8877 means NOT TRUE
            &#8704 means FOR ALL
            &#62 is the greater than comparison operator
            &#8712 means AN ELEMENT OR MEMBER OF (a set)
            #8477 is the Double-Struck Capital R signifying the set of all real numbers
            &#960 is the Greek lower case letter Pi -->
            
        <p id="para"><b><i>x<sup> n</sup> &#43 y<sup> n</sup> &#61 z<sup> n</sup></b></i>,  <b>&#8877 &#8704 <i>n</i> &#62 2</b> (Fermat's last theorem &#8718)<br><br>

        <i>[The symbol</i> &#8718 <i>is used to denote the final line of a mathematical proof. However, since the proof of this theorem is hundreds of pages long in dense mathematics I am using it here to simply denote a conclusive statement.]</i>   <center>------------------------------------</center></p>

        <p id="para">Euler's formula states that:<br><br>

        <b><i>e<sup> ix &#61 cos x &#43 i sin x</i>, &#8704 <i>x</i> &#8712 &#8477</strong></b>, where <b><i>e</i></b> is the exponential constant and <b><i>i</i><sup> 2</sup> &#61 &#8722 1.</b><br><br>
            
        However, as <b>&#960  &#8712 <strong>&#8477</strong></b> is a particular real number case we can substitute it in the place of <b><i>x</i></b>, giving:<br><br>
            
        <b><i>e<sup> i&#960 </i> &#61 cos <i>&#960</i> &#43 <i>i</i> sin <i>&#960</i></b>.<br><br>
            
        Further, since <b><i>cos &#960</i> &#61 &#8722 1</b> and <b><i>sin &#960</i></i> &#61 0</b> then it follows that:<br><br>

        <b><i>e<sup> i&#960</sup> &#61 </i> &#8722 1,</b><br><br>
        which leads to Euler's identity:<br><br>

        <b><i>e<sup> i&#960</sup></i> &#43 1 &#61 0 &#8718</b></p>

        <p id="para">This amazing identity is so profound that it is simply not fully comprehended. It includes the additive identity (zero - where any number added to it remains unchanged) and the multiplitive identity (one - where any number multiplied by it remains unchanged). It also includes the transdental real numbers <b>&#960</b> and <b><i>e</i></b>, neither of which can be defined as any form of fraction and remain constant (<b>&#960</b> [3.14159... to 5 decimal places] being the constant ratio between a circle's radius and its circumference or area and <b><i>e</i></b> [2.71828... to 5 decimal places] being the exponential constant that is frequently used to model physical and economic growth). Additionally, it includes the remarkable invention of the imaginary number <b><i>i</i></b>, which is the square root of <b>&#8722 1.</b> Although this number is imaginary it has proved to provide real world solutions in describing the propogation of electro-magnetic waves (like radio and ultra-sonic waves for example).
