    <h1>HTML Exercises Part 1</h1>
    <hr><hr>
    <p>1. Create a paragraph that is a description of a book, include the title of the book as well as its author. Names and titles should be underlined, adjectives should be italicized and bolded.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><u>Coming up for air by George Orwell</u></h3>
    <p>The book's themes are nostalgia, the folly of <i><b>trying</b></i> to go back and <i><b></b>recapture</i> past glories, and the easy way the dreams and aspirations of one's youth can be smothered by the humdrum routine of work, marriage, and getting old. It is written in the first person, with <u>George Bowling</u>, the forty-five-year-old protagonist, who reveals his life and experiences while <i><b>undertaking</b></i> a trip back to his boyhood home as an adult.</p><hr><hr>

    <p>2. Create the squared numbers for 1 - 20. Each number should be on a separate line, next to it the number 2 superscripted, an equal sign and the result. (Example: 10<sup>2</sup> = 100)​</p><hr>

    1<sup>2</sup> = 1;<br>
    2<sup>2</sup> = 4;<br>
    3<sup>2</sup> = 9;<br>
    4<sup>2</sup> = 16;<br>
    5<sup>2</sup> = 25;<br>
    6<sup>2</sup> = 36;<br>
    7<sup>2</sup> = 49;<br>
    8<sup>2</sup> = 56;<br>
    9<sup>2</sup> = 81;<br>
    10<sup>2</sup> = 100;<br><hr><hr>

    <p>3. Create two lists with any information you want. One list should be an ordered list, the other list should be an unordered list.</p><hr>

                </ul>           
        </ul>
    </ul><hr><hr>

    <p>4. Create an h1 level heading followed by a horizontal line whose width is 100%. Below the horizontal line add paragraph relating to the text in the heading</p><hr>
    <h3>Already done</h3><hr>
    <p>This functionality has already been evidenced in my work above.</p><hr><hr>

<p>5.  Create some preformatted text of your choice.</p>

<p>I would like to write some mathematics:</p>

<!--&#43 is the plus operator
    &#61 is the equals sign
    &#8877 means NOT TRUE
    &#8704 means FOR ALL
    &#62 is the greater than comparitor
    &#8712 means AN ELEMENT OR MEMBER OF (a set)
    #8477 is the Double-Struck Capital R signifying the set of all real numbers
    &#960 is the Greek lower case letter Pi -->
    
<p><b><i>x<sup> n</sup> &#43 y<sup> n</sup> &#61 z<sup> n</sup></b>,  </i><b>&#8877 &#8704 <i>n</i> &#62  </b>2 (Fermat's last theorem &#8718)</p><br>

<p>Euler's formula states that:<br>

<b><i>e<sup> ix </i> &#61 cos <i>x</i> &#43 <i>i</i> sin <i>x</i>, &#8704 <i>x</i> &#8712 </b><strong>&#8477</strong>, where <i>e</i> is the exponential constant and <i>i</i><sup> 2</sup> = -1<br><br>
    
Since &#960  &#8712 </b><strong>&#8477</strong> we can substitute it in the place of <i>x, giving:</i><br>
    
<b><i>e<sup> i&#960 </i> &#61 cos <i>&#960</i> &#43 <i>i</i> sin <i>&#960</i></b><br><br>
    
Further, since cos <i>&#960</i> &#61 &#8722 1 and sin <i>&#960</i> &#61 0 then<br>

<b><i>e<sup> i&#960</sup> &#61 </i> &#8722 1</b><br><br>
which leads to Euler's identity:<br>

<b><i>e<sup> i&#960</sup></i> &#43 1 &#61 0 </b></p><hr><hr>

<p>6. Create a long quote and a short quote. Cite the author of each quote.</p>

<h4>Martin Luther King</h4>
<p>During his address at the 'March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom' on August 28th, 1963, Dr Martin Luther King Jnr declared, "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."</p>

<h4>Rene Descartes</h4>
<p>"Latin: Cogito, ergo sum, (English: “I think, therefore I am)." Descartes, René - Discourse on Method, 1637.</p><hr><hr>

<p>7.  Create a definition list with 5 items.</p>

<h3>Definitions of Car Engine Components</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Cylinder Block</b> - This is the engine's foundation that houses cylinders and crankshaft and provides stability and support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Cylinders</b> - These are the cylindrical tubes where the air-fuel mixture undergoes combustion to generate power for the engine.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Pistons</b> - Pistons are the moving components inside cylinders that translate the combustion force into crankshaft rotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Crankshaft</b> - This is the core component of the engine that converts piston motion into rotational power for the wheels.
    </li>
    <li><b>Camshaft</b> - This component manages the control of valve opening and closing, ensuring precise synchronisation with engine cycles.
    </li>
</ol><hr><hr>

<p>8. Create five acronyms and abbreviations of your choosing, each separated by two lines. Specify the data that the abbreviations and acronyms represent.</p>

<p><b>I.T.B. (In The Black)</b> - signifying one's bank account balance is positive.</p><hr><hr>

<p><b>I.T.R. (In The Red)</b> - signifying one's bank account balance is negative.</p><hr><hr>

<p><b>S.W.A.S.R.O.A.K. (Sealed With a Smacker-roo of a Kiss)</b> - an alternative acronym to mark the evenolop of a Valetine's card.</p><hr><hr>

<p><b>S.W.E.A.T. (Swear Wholesomely, Eternally And Truly)</b> - an alternative oath given in court by a witness that cannot swear on the Bible from principle.</p><hr><hr>

<p><b>G.L.A.S.S. (Greenhouses Live As Shoddy Sheds)</b> - a greenhouse makes a very poor shed because an opportunistic thief:
    <ul>
        <li>can easily see what valuable tools may be inside and
        </li>
        <li>can easily break in due to the construction material.
        </li>
    </ul></p><hr><hr>

<p>9. Create some links to various search engines (e.g., Google). Also, they should all open in a new window.</p>
