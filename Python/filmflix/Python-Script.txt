This document is to explain my reasoning for producing a Python Script file to 
update one column of all fields in my DB.

Ideally I wanted to insert real data into my DB with genuine ratings but struggled 
to contrain my column widths for my terminal reports. I had hoped to format my 
columns using Pandas but was unable to ascertain how to import its functionality.
Therefore I descided to create a script in order to upate the data in my table in 
one go. I can then develop that script into a useful file to allow the user to 
update individual columns within the DB.
