//for loop is use to iterate over an object for a specific number of times 



// ++ is the increment operator , where we place the increment operator impacts when the increment takes place



// for Loop

// Task 2: Generate 10 random numbers between 1-100 and log them to the console/browser.

//While iterates/repeats until a condition is met


// Task 3: Create a loop that counts backwards from 20-0.



// ForEach method calls a function for each element in an array
